The data is displayed using a card element from React-Bootstrap. Additionally, the project includes a selected beast component that displays the details of a specific beast, such as its title, description, and number of horns. The number of horns can be used to filter the array of objects and display only the beasts with the selected number of horns. A form component is used as a search tool to facilitate this feature.",
